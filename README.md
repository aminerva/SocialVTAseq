# SocialVTAseq
 
This repo contains R code to analyze snRNA-seq data and generate figures from the accompanying publication.  

Analysis scripts should be run in the following order  
1) preprocessing.R  
2) integrate_objects.R  
3) UMAP_cluster.R  
4) subset_data.R  
5) findDEGs.R

Figure4.R and FigureS7.R contain code necessary to generate subpanels in the respective figures. 

snRNA-seq data used in this study have been deposited at GEO and are publicly available as of the date of publication. Accession number GEO: GSE235149. 

Accompanying 2-photon imaging data have been deposited at Mendeley Data doi:10.17632/5spnp83p2m.1 and Python code to analyze this data is available at https://github.com/lwillmore/SocialVTA2p.
